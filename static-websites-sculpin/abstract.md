# Building Static Websites with Sculpin

Sculpin (https://sculpin.io) is a static site generator written in PHP, and built on Symfony components.

In this talk, I'll speak about static site generators and why you may want to use one, the background of the Sculpin project, what it is, and what is does, how it works and how we can extend it with our own custom bundles.

Once we've done that, we'll open up a IDE and a Terminal and look at how we can build flexible, dynamic, static websites.
