# Drupal VM, meet Symfony Console

The [Drupal VM CLI][0] is a command line application, built on Symfony Console and other components, that generates configuration files for Drupal VM based on personal settings and user interaction.

After an introduction to Drupal VM itself and the Drupal VM CLI, we’ll jump into the code and see how Symfony Console applications are structured, how to write new commands, and how to integrate additional libraries like Guzzle, Twig and other Symfony components - whilst referencing code from the Drupal VM CLI project.

_TL;DR - Come and learn about Symfony Console, with examples from a real project._

**Notes:**

The Drupal VM CLI project is on GitHub at <https://github.com/opdavies/drupal-vm-cli>. I’ve given a couple of short talks about the project at user groups, though this will be more technical and more focussed on Console than previous versions of the talk.
