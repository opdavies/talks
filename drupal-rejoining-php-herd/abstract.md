# Drupal: Re-joining the PHP Herd

Drupal 8 was (finally) released on November 19th 2015, after almost 4 years of work and code commits by over 3,200 different contributors. Whilst itâ€™s pretty much the same as the Drupal that we know and, hopefully, love, a lot has changed behind the scenes and under the hood!

In this talk, I'll highlight some of the new features and improvements in Drupal 8, and discuss some of the benefits to Drupal site builders, themers, and module developers. I'll also talk about some of the non-technical changes and the cultural shift from "not invented here" to "proudly found elsewhere", and how we are rejoining the PHP herd.
